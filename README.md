# Lightning-InfiniteScroll
Using Infinite Scroll inside a Salesforce Lightning Component (**Atention**: Require disable Locker Service)


This was an alternative to make an Innfinite Scroll inside the Lightning Componente, using aura, because of Locker Service disable the ability to set onScroll event we need to disable Locker Service.

And because we can't get element.scrollTop, I need get this on another way.
